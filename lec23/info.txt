# practical introuction to promises
Promise is an asynchromous method to execute some task 
basically is has two state one is pending ie working or another is settled ie either fulfiled or rejected


A JavaScript Promise object can be:

Pending
Fulfilled
Rejected
The Promise object supports two properties: state and result.

While a Promise object is "pending" (working), the result is undefined.

When a Promise object is "fulfilled", the result is a value.

When a Promise object is "rejected", the result is an error object.
